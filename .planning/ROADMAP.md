## Phase Details

### Phase 36: Event Emitter Abstraction

**Goal**: Background tasks deliver host events through an abstract port, eliminating direct AppHandle coupling
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v0.4.0)
**Requirements**: EVNT-01, EVNT-02, EVNT-03, EVNT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. HostEventEmitterPort trait exists in uc-core/ports and compiles without any Tauri dependency
2. TauriEventEmitter adapter wraps AppHandle and implements HostEventEmitterPort; GUI app continues to emit clipboard and sync events to the frontend as before
3. LoggingEventEmitter adapter exists and implements HostEventEmitterPort by writing events to tracing output
4. Clipboard watcher, peer discovery, and sync scheduler accept HostEventEmitterPort instead of AppHandle<R>; the compiler rejects any direct AppHandle use in these components

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:

- [ ] 36-01-PLAN.md — Define HostEventEmitterPort trait, HostEvent type system, TauriEventEmitter and LoggingEventEmitter adapters with contract tests
- [ ] 36-02-PLAN.md — Wire emitter port into AppRuntime, wiring.rs, and file_transfer_wiring.rs; delete obsolete event types

### Phase 37: Wiring Decomposition

**Goal**: wiring.rs is split into a pure Rust assembly module (no Tauri types) and a thin Tauri-specific event loop layer
**Depends on**: Phase 36
**Requirements**: RNTM-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A new pure-assembly module exists that constructs application dependencies without importing any tauri crate; it compiles as a library with no Tauri feature flags
2. A separate Tauri-specific module (wiring.rs) owns the Tauri event loop setup, app handle wiring, and command registration; within the wiring split pair, it is the only module that imports tauri types (assembly.rs has zero tauri imports)
3. Existing GUI behavior is unchanged: clipboard sync, pairing, and settings all continue to function after the split
4. assembly.rs contains zero tauri imports (verified by CI lint) and its public API is Tauri-type-free, preparing it for independent `cargo check` in Phase 40 when uc-bootstrap crate is created

**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md — Define PairingHostEvent, SetupHostEvent, SpaceAccessHostEvent in uc-core; extend TauriEventEmitter + LoggingEventEmitter with contract tests
- [x] 37-02-PLAN.md — Migrate all app.emit() calls in wiring.rs and file_transfer_wiring.rs to HostEventEmitterPort
- [x] 37-03-PLAN.md — Split wiring.rs into assembly.rs + wiring.rs, remove AppHandle from start_background_tasks, update ROADMAP

### Phase 38: CoreRuntime Extraction

**Goal**: A Tauri-free CoreRuntime struct holds AppDeps and orchestrators; SetupOrchestrator assembly lives in one composition point
**Depends on**: Phase 37
**Requirements**: RNTM-01, RNTM-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. CoreRuntime struct exists in a crate with no Tauri dependency, holds AppDeps and shared orchestrators, and passes `cargo check` independently
2. AppRuntime wraps CoreRuntime and adds only Tauri-specific handles; no orchestration logic lives in AppRuntime itself
3. SetupOrchestrator is assembled exactly once in the main composition root; runtime.rs contains no secondary wiring or orchestrator construction
4. The existing GUI setup flow (first-run setup, encrypted space unlock) continues to work end-to-end

**Plans:** 4 plans (3 complete + 1 gap closure)

Plans:

- [ ] 38-01-PLAN.md — Move TaskRegistry and lifecycle adapters from uc-tauri to uc-app (prerequisites)
- [ ] 38-02-PLAN.md — Create CoreRuntime in uc-app, refactor AppRuntime to wrap it, fix stale emitter bug
- [ ] 38-03-PLAN.md — Split UseCases into CoreUseCases + AppUseCases, extract SetupOrchestrator to assembly.rs

### Phase 39: Config Resolution Extraction

**Goal**: Path resolution, profile suffix derivation, and keyslot directory logic are extracted from main.rs into a reusable, testable module
**Depends on**: Phase 38
**Requirements**: RNTM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A dedicated config resolution module (not main.rs) owns all path/profile/keyslot resolution functions and is accessible to non-Tauri entry points
2. main.rs delegates to the module rather than containing inline resolution logic; main.rs shrinks accordingly
3. The resolution functions are unit-testable without a running Tauri app
4. GUI app launches and resolves config paths correctly after the extraction

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:

- [ ] 39-01-PLAN.md — Create config_resolution.rs module with resolve_config_path, resolve_app_config, ConfigResolutionError, and migrated tests
- [ ] 39-02-PLAN.md — Wire main.rs to use config_resolution module, delete duplicate functions, consolidate key_slot_store path resolution

### Phase 40: uc-bootstrap Crate

**Goal**: uc-bootstrap exists as the sole composition root; all entry points depend on it instead of wiring uc-infra and uc-platform directly
**Depends on**: Phase 39
**Requirements**: BOOT-01, BOOT-02, BOOT-03, BOOT-04, BOOT-05, RNTM-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. uc-bootstrap crate exists with declared dependencies on uc-core, uc-app, uc-infra, and uc-platform; `cargo check` passes
2. build_cli_context() function exists in uc-bootstrap and returns a CLI-ready dependency set without starting background workers
3. build_daemon_app() function exists in uc-bootstrap and returns daemon-ready dependencies with worker handles
4. uc-tauri's Cargo.toml lists uc-bootstrap as a dependency and no longer directly depends on uc-infra or uc-platform for composition
5. UseCases accessor is instantiated inside uc-bootstrap and shared to all entry points; no entry point constructs its own UseCases
6. Logging initialization (init_tracing_subscriber) is called exactly once inside uc-bootstrap; duplicate calls in main.rs or other entry points are removed

**Plans:** 2/3 plans executed

Plans:

- [ ] 40-01-PLAN.md — Create uc-bootstrap crate, move assembly/config/tracing/init modules, make tracing idempotent, wire uc-tauri re-exports
- [ ] 40-02-PLAN.md — Create scene-specific builders (build_gui_app, build_cli_context, build_daemon_app) with shared build_core helper
- [ ] 40-03-PLAN.md — Migrate main.rs to use build_gui_app(), update root Cargo.toml, verify GUI app functions correctly

### Phase 41: Daemon and CLI Skeletons

**Goal**: uc-daemon and uc-cli crates exist with working startup paths, end-to-end RPC connectivity, and direct command execution validated
**Depends on**: Phase 40
**Requirements**: DAEM-01, DAEM-02, DAEM-03, DAEM-04, CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03, CLI-04, CLI-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. uc-daemon binary starts, initializes via uc-bootstrap, logs startup, and shuts down gracefully on SIGTERM/Ctrl-C without panicking
2. Running `uniclipboard-daemon` then `uniclipboard-cli status` returns a JSON response containing uptime and worker health fields
3. Running `uniclipboard-cli devices` (direct mode via uc-bootstrap) returns a device list without the daemon running
4. `uniclipboard-cli --json status` outputs valid JSON; `uniclipboard-cli status` (no flag) outputs human-readable text
5. Exit codes are stable: 0 on success, 1 on error, 5 when daemon is unreachable
6. DaemonWorker trait exists; placeholder clipboard watcher and peer discovery workers implement it and are registered with DaemonApp

**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

Plans:

- [ ] 41-01-PLAN.md — Create LoggingHostEventEmitter + build_non_gui_runtime() in uc-bootstrap; create uc-daemon crate with DaemonWorker trait, placeholder workers, RPC types, RuntimeState
- [ ] 41-02-PLAN.md — Create RPC server, handler, DaemonApp lifecycle, and daemon main.rs entry point
- [ ] 41-03-PLAN.md — Create uc-cli crate with clap parsing, status command (RPC), devices and space-status commands (direct mode), --json flag, exit codes
- [ ] 41-04-PLAN.md — Fix socket path SUN_LEN overflow: extract shared resolve_daemon_socket_path to uc-daemon, wire daemon and CLI (gap closure)

- [x] 54-01-PLAN.md -- Create uc-daemon-client crate with HTTP clients, ws_bridge, realtime, connection (Wave 1)
- [x] 54-02-PLAN.md -- Update uc-tauri call sites, delete old modules, verify clean build (Wave 2, depends on 54-01)

### Phase 55: Extract daemon lifecycle and setup pairing bridge from uc-tauri

**Goal:** [To be planned]
**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 54
**Plans:** 2/3 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 55 to break down) (completed 2026-03-24)

### Phase 56: Refactor daemon host architecture — extract peer lifecycle from PairingHost, unify host lifecycle management

**Goal:** Refactor daemon host architecture so peer lifecycle handling is isolated in `PeerMonitor` and all long-lived daemon components run through one unified service lifecycle without changing the external pairing/setup API contract.
**Requirements**: PH56-01, PH56-02, PH56-03, PH56-04
**Depends on:** Phase 55
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:

- [ ] 56-01-PLAN.md — Rename daemon worker abstractions to service vocabulary without changing transport contracts
- [ ] 56-02-PLAN.md — Extract `PeerMonitor` and remove peer lifecycle handling from `DaemonPairingHost`
- [ ] 56-03-PLAN.md — Unify `DaemonApp` service lifecycle management while preserving typed pairing-host API access

### Phase 56.1: Eliminate hardcoded strings in pairing/setup flow (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Extract scattered hardcoded string literals (WS topic/event names, session state labels, pairing busy reasons, HTTP API paths) into shared constants in uc-core, eliminating cross-crate duplication and reducing wire-protocol mismatch risk.
**Requirements**: PH561-01, PH561-02, PH561-03, PH561-04, PH561-05
**Depends on:** Phase 56
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 56.1-01-PLAN.md — Define daemon wire-protocol string constants in uc-core daemon_api_strings module
- [x] 56.1-02-PLAN.md — Replace hardcoded strings in uc-daemon (server side) with uc-core constants
- [x] 56.1-03-PLAN.md — Replace hardcoded strings in uc-daemon-client (client side) with uc-core constants

### Phase 57: Daemon Clipboard Watcher Integration

**Goal:** Migrate clipboard watching from GUI/PlatformRuntime to daemon as the sole clipboard monitor. Daemon captures OS clipboard changes, persists entries, broadcasts WS events; GUI operates in Passive mode receiving updates via DaemonWsBridge.
**Requirements**: PH57-01, PH57-02, PH57-03, PH57-04, PH57-05, PH57-06, PH57-07
**Depends on:** Phase 56
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 57-01-PLAN.md — Real ClipboardWatcherWorker with DaemonClipboardChangeHandler, CaptureClipboardUseCase, and clipboard.new_content WS event emission
- [x] 57-02-PLAN.md — DaemonWsBridge clipboard translation, clipboard realtime consumer, and GUI Passive mode switch
- [x] 57-03-PLAN.md — Write-back loop prevention via shared ClipboardChangeOriginPort in DaemonClipboardChangeHandler

### Phase 58: Extract DTO models and pairing event types from uc-tauri to uc-app and uc-core

**Goal:** Unify duplicate clipboard DTOs (add serde to uc-app, delete uc-tauri duplicates), extract pairing aggregation DTOs to uc-app, and delete stale pairing event types. After this phase, uc-tauri has zero duplicate DTO definitions.
**Requirements**: PH58-01, PH58-02, PH58-03, PH58-04, PH58-05
**Depends on:** Phase 57
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `EntryProjectionDto` in uc-app has serde derives and is the single source of truth for clipboard entry projections (no duplicate in uc-tauri)
2. `ClipboardStats` in uc-app has serde derives and is the single source of truth (no duplicate in uc-tauri)
3. `P2PPeerInfo` and `PairedPeer` live in uc-app alongside `P2pPeerSnapshot` and `LocalDeviceInfo`
4. `P2PPairingVerificationEvent`/`P2PPairingVerificationKind` are deleted (stale dead code)
5. Frontend JSON wire contract is preserved (snake_case fields, `file_transfer_ids` absent, `link_domains` present)

Plans:

- [x] 58-01-PLAN.md — Unify clipboard DTOs: add serde to EntryProjectionDto and ClipboardStats in uc-app, delete duplicates from uc-tauri models
- [x] 58-02-PLAN.md — Extract pairing DTOs (P2PPeerInfo, PairedPeer) to uc-app and delete stale P2PPairingVerificationEvent types

### Phase 59: Secure daemon resource endpoints with scoped token auth

**Goal:** Migrate blob/thumbnail resource serving from Tauri's in-process `uc://` protocol handler to daemon HTTP endpoints (`/uc/blob/:id`, `/uc/thumbnail/:id`) with production-grade security designed for future `0.0.0.0` exposure. Multi-layer security: scoped resource tokens (15s TTL, lazy refresh), rate limiting (blob 20 req/s, thumbnail 100 req/s), Origin check, encryption session binding, audit logging. GUI retains `uc://` as transparent proxy via daemon-client; frontend zero changes.
**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 58
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 59 to break down)

### ~~Phase 60: Extract file transfer wiring orchestration from uc-tauri to uc-app~~ ✅ (2026-03-25)

**Goal:** Extract `file_transfer_wiring.rs` (502 lines, zero Tauri deps) from `uc-tauri/bootstrap/` into a `FileTransferOrchestrator` struct in `uc-app`, making file transfer lifecycle management available to non-Tauri runtimes (daemon, CLI).
**Requirements**: PH60-01, PH60-02, PH60-03, PH60-04, PH60-05
**Depends on:** Phase 59
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `FileTransferOrchestrator` struct exists in `uc-app/src/usecases/file_sync/` holding tracker + emitter + clock + early_completion_cache
2. All 9 standalone functions from `file_transfer_wiring.rs` are methods on the orchestrator
3. `uc-bootstrap/assembly.rs` provides `build_file_transfer_orchestrator()` builder function
4. `wiring.rs` calls orchestrator methods at all integration points
5. `file_transfer_wiring.rs` is deleted from uc-tauri with no re-export stubs

Plans:

- [x] 60-01-PLAN.md — Create FileTransferOrchestrator in uc-app and wire into uc-bootstrap assembly
- [x] 60-02-PLAN.md — Rewire wiring.rs to use FileTransferOrchestrator, delete file_transfer_wiring.rs

### Phase 61: Daemon outbound clipboard sync — trigger sync to peers after local capture

**Goal:** After daemon captures a local clipboard change, trigger OutboundSyncPlanner to decide sync eligibility, then dispatch SyncOutboundClipboardUseCase and SyncOutboundFileUseCase to push content to paired peers — mirroring the AppRuntime::on_clipboard_changed flow.
**Requirements**: PH61-01, PH61-02, PH61-03, PH61-04
**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. DaemonClipboardChangeHandler triggers OutboundSyncPlanner + SyncOutboundClipboardUseCase after successful LocalCapture
2. RemotePush origin clipboard changes do NOT trigger outbound sync (no double-sync loop)
3. File clipboard items produce FileCandidate vec with correct extracted_paths_count
4. SyncOutboundClipboardUseCase::execute() runs via spawn_blocking (not directly in async context)

Plans:

- [x] 61-01-PLAN.md — Extend DaemonClipboardChangeHandler with outbound sync dispatch (OutboundSyncPlanner + SyncOutboundClipboardUseCase + SyncOutboundFileUseCase)

### Phase 62: Daemon inbound clipboard sync — receive peer clipboard and write to local system

**Goal:** Daemon receives inbound clipboard messages from peers via ClipboardTransportPort, applies them through SyncInboundClipboardUseCase (Full mode), writes to OS clipboard, and broadcasts clipboard.new_content WS events — mirroring the wiring.rs run_clipboard_receive_loop pattern.
**Requirements**: PH62-01, PH62-02, PH62-03, PH62-04, PH62-05
**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. InboundClipboardSyncWorker implements DaemonService with subscribe-loop pattern
2. SyncInboundClipboardUseCase constructed in Full mode via with_capture_dependencies
3. WS event emitted only for Applied { entry*id: Some(*) } outcomes (not for None or Skipped)
4. Shared clipboard_change_origin Arc prevents write-back loops between inbound sync and ClipboardWatcher
5. Full uc-daemon test suite passes

Plans:

- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — Create InboundClipboardSyncWorker with subscribe-loop, SyncInboundClipboardUseCase (Full mode), conditional WS event emission, and registration in daemon main.rs

### Phase 63: Daemon file transfer orchestration — handle file sync lifecycle in daemon

**Goal:** Wire FileTransferOrchestrator into daemon: extend DaemonApiEventEmitter to forward Transfer StatusChanged WS events, extend InboundClipboardSyncWorker to seed pending transfer records, and create FileSyncOrchestratorWorker that subscribes to network events for transfer lifecycle management (progress, completed, failed), startup reconciliation, timeout sweeps, and clipboard restore.
**Requirements**: PH63-01, PH63-02, PH63-03, PH63-04, PH63-05, PH63-06, PH63-07
**Depends on:** Phase 62
**Plans:** 2 plans

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. DaemonApiEventEmitter emits file-transfer.status_changed WS events for Transfer StatusChanged host events (not silently dropped)
2. InboundClipboardSyncWorker seeds pending transfer DB records when Applied outcome contains file transfers
3. Early completion cache reconciliation runs after pending records are seeded
4. FileSyncOrchestratorWorker subscribes to NetworkEventPort and handles TransferProgress, FileTransferCompleted, FileTransferFailed events
5. Startup reconciliation marks orphaned in-flight transfers as failed before event loop starts
6. Timeout sweep runs on 15s interval and is cancelled on daemon shutdown
7. Full uc-daemon test suite passes with all new workers registered

Plans:

- [ ] 63-01-PLAN.md — Add file-transfer WS constants, extend DaemonApiEventEmitter for Transfer StatusChanged, extend InboundClipboardSyncWorker with orchestrator for pending record seeding
- [ ] 63-02-PLAN.md — Create FileSyncOrchestratorWorker with network event loop, startup reconciliation, timeout sweep, and register in daemon main.rs

### Phase 64: Tauri sync retirement — remove sync logic from Tauri, delegate to daemon

**Goal:** [To be planned]
**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 63
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 64 to break down)
