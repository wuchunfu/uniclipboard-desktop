## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 19: Start observability work by refactoring the tracing subscriber into dual-output profile-driven logging.
- Phase 20: Capture observability uses `flow_id` and `stage` as the canonical clipboard pipeline correlation fields.
- Phase 21: Sync observability must reuse the same flow model as local capture rather than inventing a second tracing pattern.
- Phase 22: Seq remains local and configuration-driven for this milestone; full OTel and multi-backend support stay deferred.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 22 likely needs extra validation around CLEF field mapping and Seq waterfall/query behavior.
- Existing `log::*` and `tracing::*` coexistence may need an audit during Phase 19 to avoid mixed-output surprises.
