## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.3.0]: OutboundSyncPlanner consolidation — single policy decision point, runtime as thin dispatcher
- [v0.2.0]: Private deps + facade accessors on AppRuntime — compiler-enforced boundary
- [Phase 36-event-emitter-abstraction]: HostEventEmitterPort synchronous (not async) matching tauri::Emitter::emit() non-async signature
- [Phase 36-event-emitter-abstraction]: PeerConnectionHostEvent collapses PeerReady/PeerConnected to Connected; PeerNotReady/PeerDisconnected to Disconnected — matching frontend binary connected:bool view
- [Phase 36-event-emitter-abstraction]: event_emitter uses RwLock<Arc<dyn Port>> not bare Arc — allows bootstrap swap from LoggingEventEmitter to TauriEventEmitter after AppHandle available
- [Phase 36-event-emitter-abstraction]: app_handle KEPT alongside event_emitter for out-of-scope callers (commands/pairing.rs, commands/clipboard.rs, apply_autostart, setup orchestrator)
- [Phase 36-event-emitter-abstraction]: file_transfer_wiring.rs handle_transfer_progress/completed/failed/spawn_timeout_sweep/reconcile_on_startup deferred to Phase 37 wiring decomposition
- [Phase 37-wiring-decomposition]: app.emit() calls replaced with HostEventEmitterPort; TauriSetupEventPort replaced by HostEventSetupPort; \_app_handle params deferred to Plan 03
- [Phase 37-wiring-decomposition P03]: assembly.rs created with zero tauri imports; BackgroundRuntimeDeps stays in wiring.rs; PlatformLayer made pub(crate) for test access; invoke_handler stays in main.rs (generate_handler! macro constraint)
- [Phase 37-wiring-decomposition]: Synchronously write activeSessionIdRef.current before calling acceptP2PPairing to close verification event race window — useEffect-based ref sync is too late when backend emits immediately
- [Phase 37-wiring-decomposition]: Subscribe before initiate: pairing event subscription moved before initiate_pairing in ensure_pairing_session to eliminate race window
- [Phase 37-wiring-decomposition]: app_closed_tx flag guards StreamClosedByPeer->PairingFailed bridge from firing on explicit application-initiated session closes
- [Phase 38-coreruntime-extraction]: tokio-util added to uc-app without 'sync' feature — locked version 0.7.17 includes CancellationToken in default features
- [Phase 38-coreruntime-extraction]: resolve_pairing_device_name inlined into uc-app/adapters.rs to keep uc-app free of uc-tauri dependency
- [Phase 38-coreruntime-extraction]: uc-tauri re-export pattern used for TaskRegistry (pub use uc_app::task_registry::TaskRegistry) for backward compatibility
- [Phase 38]: CoreRuntime::new() accepts pre-built Arc<RwLock<Arc<dyn HostEventEmitterPort>>> — caller creates the cell, CoreRuntime never wraps internally
- [Phase 38]: emitter_cell created once in with_setup() and shared with both build_setup_orchestrator and CoreRuntime::new() — same Arc, no copies
- [Phase 38-coreruntime-extraction]: AppUseCases wraps CoreUseCases via Deref<Target=CoreUseCases> — all ~35 pure domain accessors transparent without duplication
- [Phase 38-coreruntime-extraction]: build_setup_orchestrator extracted to assembly.rs as standalone pub fn — satisfies RNTM-05 single composition point, eliminating secondary wiring in runtime.rs
- [Phase 38-coreruntime-extraction]: SetupAssemblyPorts contains only 5 external adapter ports; shared-cell params (emitter_cell, lifecycle_status, watcher_control, session_ready_emitter, clipboard_integration_mode) are separate build_setup_orchestrator params
- [Phase 39]: config_resolution.rs in uc-tauri/bootstrap/ (not uc-app) — DirsAppDirsAdapter (uc-platform) cannot be a prod dep of uc-app
- [Phase 39]: resolve_app_config() returns Result<AppConfig, ConfigResolutionError> with typed enum variants for InvalidConfig and PlatformDirsFailed
- [Phase 39]: main.rs imports uc_tauri::bootstrap::resolve_app_config via bootstrap/mod.rs re-export; storage_paths moved before key_slot_store construction so vault_dir is available
- [Phase 40]: Assembly helpers widened to pub for cross-crate test access; PlatformLayer made pub in uc-bootstrap
- [Phase 40]: Re-export stub pattern: uc-tauri bootstrap modules become thin pub use uc_bootstrap::module::\* stubs
- [Phase 40]: Idempotent tracing: TRACING_INITIALIZED OnceLock guard allows safe multiple init_tracing_subscriber calls
- [Phase 40]: Builders return AppDeps (not CoreRuntime) per Codex Review R1 -- callers construct CoreRuntime with appropriate emitter/lifecycle
- [Phase 40]: GUI builder uses standalone tokio::runtime::Builder (not tauri::async_runtime) to keep uc-bootstrap tauri-free
- [Phase 41]: ClipboardIntegrationMode::Passive used for non-GUI modes (Disabled variant does not exist); Passive correctly disables OS clipboard observation
- [Phase 41]: DaemonWorker trait: async start(CancellationToken), async stop(), sync health_check() -> WorkerHealth; RuntimeState is snapshot-only (no worker ownership)
- [Phase 41]: Explicit tokio runtime construction (not #[tokio::main]) for daemon to avoid conflicts with tracing init's internal Seq runtime
- [Phase 41]: DaemonApp binds RPC socket before starting workers for fail-fast on already-running daemon
- [Phase 41]: Workers stored as Vec<Arc<dyn DaemonWorker>> for tokio::spawn 'static compatibility
- [Phase 41]: CLI dual-dispatch: status via daemon RPC, devices/space-status via direct bootstrap
- [Phase 41]: Unix socket path resolution is centralized in uc-daemon so daemon and CLI cannot drift
- [Phase 41]: On Unix, overlong XDG runtime paths warn and fall back to /tmp to stay under the 103-byte sun_path payload limit
- [Phase 43]: GetP2pPeersSnapshot uses both PeerDirectoryPort AND PairedDeviceRepositoryPort - cross-port aggregation in app layer
- [Phase 43]: P2pPeerSnapshot preserves pairing_state and identity_fingerprint for CLI output compatibility
- [Phase 43]: Aggregation logic extracted from Tauri commands into shared uc-app use case - GUI and CLI now share same business logic

### Roadmap Evolution

v0.3.0 phases (19-35) completed and archived.
v0.4.0 runs phases 36-41. Phase numbering is continuous.

- Phase 42 added: CLI Clipboard Commands — list, get, and clear clipboard entries via CLI
- Phase 43 added: Unify GUI and CLI business flows to eliminate per-entrypoint feature adaptation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 40 (uc-bootstrap) is high risk: crate extraction touches dependency graph across uc-tauri, uc-infra, uc-platform. Verify cargo workspace configuration before planning.

### Known Bugs (deferred to future phases)

- **[Phase 38] setup_event_port holds stale LoggingEventEmitter**: `HostEventSetupPort` captures the initial `LoggingEventEmitter` Arc at `AppRuntime::with_setup` creation time (runtime.rs:420-422). When `set_event_emitter` swaps to `TauriEventEmitter` (main.rs:673-677), the swap does NOT propagate to `SetupOrchestrator`'s internal `setup_event_port`. Result: state changes emitted from spawned listener tasks (e.g. `ProcessingJoinSpace → JoinSpaceConfirmPeer` via `start_pairing_verification_listener_with_rx`) only log to console but never reach the frontend. Orchestrator dispatch-driven transitions work because the Tauri command return value carries the state directly. **Fix**: Phase 38 unifies SetupOrchestrator assembly into a single composition point, eliminating the two-phase emitter swap problem. **UAT impact**: PeerB setup UI does not advance from ProcessingJoinSpace to JoinSpaceConfirmPeer (PIN confirm screen) even though backend state is correct.
