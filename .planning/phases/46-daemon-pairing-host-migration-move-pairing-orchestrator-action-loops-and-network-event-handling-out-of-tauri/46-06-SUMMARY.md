requires:
  - phase: 46-05
    provides: daemon pairing bridge/runtime ownership baseline
provides:
  - daemon pairing regression fixtures aligned with current DaemonPairingHost constructor
  - PH46 requirement definitions and traceability rows in REQUIREMENTS.md

  patterns:
    - keep daemon test fixtures synchronized with production constructor signatures

key-decisions:
  - 'Use broadcast::channel<DaemonWsEvent>(128) in both daemon regression fixtures to satisfy DaemonPairingHost::new without changing host behavior.'
  - 'Add a dedicated Daemon Pairing Host Migration subsection so all PH46 IDs are explicitly defined and traceable.'
patterns-established:
  - 'Regression fixtures must include all constructor dependencies introduced in daemon host evolution.'
  - 'Each phase requirement ID referenced by plans/roadmap must exist in REQUIREMENTS.md and Traceability.'

# Phase 46 Plan 6: Gap Closure For Daemon Pairing Regression Tests And PH46 Traceability Summary

**Daemon pairing host/API regression suites now compile against the 7-argument constructor, and PH46 requirements are fully defined and mapped in requirements traceability.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-20T05:04:38Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-20T05:06:53Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Repaired `pairing_host` fixture wiring to provide `broadcast::Sender<DaemonWsEvent>` to `DaemonPairingHost::new`.
- Repaired `pairing_api` fixture wiring to provide `broadcast::Sender<DaemonWsEvent>` to `DaemonPairingHost::new`.
- Added PH46-01 through PH46-06 (including PH46-01A/01B/03A/05A) and phase-46 traceability rows in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Repair daemon pairing regression fixtures for the updated DaemonPairingHost constructor** - `e9b90f89` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Add Phase 46 requirement definitions and phase traceability rows to REQUIREMENTS.md** - `e7f5fc0e` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/46-daemon-pairing-host-migration-move-pairing-orchestrator-action-loops-and-network-event-handling-out-of-tauri/46-06-SUMMARY.md` - Execution summary for plan 46-06.
- `src-tauri/crates/uc-daemon/tests/pairing_host.rs` - Added daemon websocket event sender fixture wiring.
- `src-tauri/crates/uc-daemon/tests/pairing_api.rs` - Added daemon websocket event sender fixture wiring.
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Added Daemon Pairing Host Migration requirements and PH46 traceability rows.

## Decisions Made

- Added `broadcast::channel::<DaemonWsEvent>(128)` fixture wiring in tests rather than changing daemon host behavior.
- Kept PH46 requirement text explicit and one-to-one with plan IDs to satisfy audit traceability.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 46 plan set is complete with 46-06 summary in place; ready for phase-level verification/closeout flow.

## Self-Check: PASSED
