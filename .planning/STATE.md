# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Seamless clipboard synchronization across devices -- copy on one, paste on another
**Current focus:** Milestone v0.2.0 execution in progress; Phase 14 lifecycle DTO/frontend integration

## Current Position

Phase: 14 of 14 (Lifecycle DTO + Frontend Integration)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (14-02 executing)
Current Plan: 2
Total Plans in Phase: 2
Status: Phase 14 plan 01 complete; plan 02 lifecycle UI + tests implemented
Last activity: 2026-03-08

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Consolidated phases 1-9 under a single archived milestone label (`v0.1.0`) per user request.
- Rebuilt milestone-level roadmap and requirements archives from phase summaries and roadmap evidence.
- Kept unresolved architecture deep-review items as next-milestone active goals.
- Started v0.2.0 milestone from issue #214 as the primary remediation scope.
- Scoped v0.2.0 around boundary, contracts, lifecycle, and decomposition/testability baselines.
- [Phase 10-boundary-repair-baseline]: 10-02 uses buffer-then-decrypt through TransferPayloadDecryptorPort to enforce platform-core boundary.
- [Phase 10-boundary-repair-baseline]: uc-platform no longer depends on uc-infra; bootstrap wiring owns concrete crypto adapter construction.
- [Phase 10]: Keep command-layer access restricted to runtime.usecases() and facade methods only.
- [Phase 10]: Finalize 10-01 with existing task commits and document out-of-scope compile blocker in src-tauri/src/main.rs.
- [Phase 10-03]: ClipboardIntegrationMode promoted to uc-core as a shared domain type to avoid uc-app↔uc-platform dependency cycles.
- [Phase 10-03]: AppRuntime::wiring_deps() added for bootstrap code access; command handlers must use usecases() only.
- [Phase 10-03]: StartClipboardWatcherPort kept in uc-core (domain contract used by AppLifecycleCoordinator — cannot be in uc-platform).
- [Phase 11-01]: LifecycleStatusDto wraps LifecycleState enum in a struct with camelCase serde convention.
- [Phase 11-01]: Tests placed in integration test files due to pre-existing encryption.rs test compilation failures.
- [Phase 11-01]: Added Deserialize to LifecycleState for DTO round-trip testing.
- [Phase 11]: CommandError tests in integration test files due to pre-existing encryption.rs compile failures
- [Phase 11]: CommandError enum uses serde tag=code content=message for frontend discriminated union handling
- [Phase 12]: TaskRegistry spawns wrapped in single async orchestration block since start_background_tasks is sync
- [Phase 12]: StagedPairedDeviceStore uses std::sync::Mutex (not tokio) and clear() is public for lifecycle shutdown
- [Phase 12]: uc-platform added as dev-dep of uc-app for InMemoryEncryptionSessionPort test access
- [Phase 13]: testing.rs module is pub (not cfg(test)) to allow integration tests to import shared noops
- [Phase 13]: paired_device_repo merged into DevicePorts sub-struct since pairing is device-related
- [Phase 13]: PairingSessionManager owns sessions and session_peers maps; orchestrator accesses via accessor methods
- [Phase 13]: PairingProtocolHandler receives session/peer map references per-call rather than owning them
- [Phase 13]: Session state passed as borrowed Arc refs to action executor methods -- avoids circular ownership
- [Phase 14-01]: Frontend represents lifecycle status as LifecycleStatusDto DTO, not bare string state.
- [Phase 14-01]: CommandError is modeled as { code, message } discriminated union, ready for future UI handling.
- [Phase 14-02]: Dashboard lifecycle banner is driven by LifecycleStatusDto.state, covering Idle/Pending (initialization) and WatcherFailed/NetworkFailed (failure) states with a retry action.
- [Phase 14-02]: Backend lifecycle and CommandError contracts are guarded by dedicated uc-tauri tests; frontend DTO shapes are validated via Vitest.
- [Phase 15-clipboard-management-command-wiring]: Clipboard stats aggregation lives in uc-app helper and is exposed to uc-tauri via a dedicated DTO and command.
- [Phase 15-clipboard-management-command-wiring]: Toggle favorite validates entry existence but defers schema persistence; get_clipboard_item reuses list_entry_projections.
- [Phase 16]: execute_single returns Ok(None) for missing selection/representation, matching execute() skip behavior
- [Phase 16]: get_clipboard_entry uses ClipboardEntriesResponse enum for frontend API consistency
- [Phase 16]: Throttle window reduced to 300ms; getClipboardEntry returns null on error for silent fallback; transformProjectionToResponse extracted as shared helper

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 16 added: Optimize DashboardPage refresh mechanism on new clipboard content

### Pending Todos

None.

### Known Issues

- **Restore triggers duplicate entry on remote peer**: When peerA restores a clipboard entry from history, peerA treats it as a restore (content goes back to OS clipboard). However, peerB receives it as a brand new clipboard event and creates a duplicate entry, even if peerB already has an entry with the same content hash. Root cause: inbound sync does not deduplicate against existing entries by content hash. Not a critical issue but causes UI clutter on remote peers.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Architecture/lifecycle remediation touches cross-cutting modules and must preserve sync stability.
