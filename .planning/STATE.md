## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 19-02: Used generic impl Layer<S> return types for builder functions to enable caller composition without Box<dyn> type issues.
- 19-02: Re-exported WorkerGuard from uc-observability to avoid adding tracing-appender as direct dependency.
- 19-01: Used JsonFields as field formatter so FlatJsonFormat can extract structured span data from extensions.
- 19-01: Sentry integration excluded from uc-observability to keep zero app-layer dependencies.
- Phase 19: Start observability work by refactoring the tracing subscriber into dual-output profile-driven logging.
- Phase 20: Capture observability uses `flow_id` and `stage` as the canonical clipboard pipeline correlation fields.
- Phase 21: Sync observability must reuse the same flow model as local capture rather than inventing a second tracing pattern.
- Phase 22: Seq remains local and configuration-driven for this milestone; full OTel and multi-backend support stay deferred.
- [Phase 20]: UUID v7 chosen for FlowId (time-ordered) over v4 (random)
- [Phase 20]: Stage constant values are lowercase snake_case matching const names for queryability
- 20-02: Replaced #[tracing::instrument] with manual span to support runtime-computed flow_id field
- 20-02: outbound_sync span carries flow_id but no stage field (Phase 21 adds publish stage)
- [Phase 20]: Split cache_representations into two sequential stage spans (cache_representations + spool_blobs) for distinct observability
- 21-01: origin_flow_id uses serde(default) + skip_serializing_if for zero-cost backward compatibility with older peers
- 22-01: SeqGuard drop uses std::thread::spawn for block_on to avoid runtime-in-runtime panic
- 22-01: SeqLayer implements Layer trait directly rather than using FormatEvent through fmt::layer()
- 22-01: CLEF format has no conflict resolution (simpler than FlatJsonFormat) since it targets Seq only
- 22-02: Seq layer uses Option<Layer> pattern for zero-overhead when disabled
- 22-02: hyper=info and hyper_util=info added to NOISE_FILTERS to suppress Seq HTTP client debug noise
- [Phase 24]: Upsert ON CONFLICT SET excludes sync_settings to avoid overwriting per-device overrides during pairing
- [Phase 24]: serde(default) on sync_settings for backward-compatible deserialization of existing PairedDevice data
- [Phase 24]: Settings loaded from storage each time (not cached) -- SQLite + WAL fast for 2-5 devices
- [Phase 24]: Peers not in paired_device table proceed with sync as safety fallback
- [Phase 24]: Per-device auto_sync filtering applied before ensure_business_path to avoid unnecessary connections
- 24-03: Removed permissions section from DeviceSettingsPanel per user feedback
- 24-03: Content type toggles made non-editable since sync engine filtering not yet implemented
- 25-02: Editable vs coming_soon status field on contentTypeEntries drives badge and interactivity
- 25-02: All-disabled warning uses Object.values().every() on content_types for computed state
- [Phase 25]: ContentTypes::default() fix from derive(Default) all-false to explicit all-true impl
- [Phase 25]: Classify snapshot once before peer loop for efficiency (not per-peer)
- [Phase 25]: Only Text and Image are filterable; unimplemented types always sync
- [Phase 26]: Exposed apply_sync_policy as pub for integration tests in tests/ to validate policy logic directly
- [Phase 26]: Global auto_sync guard executes before per-device evaluation and does not mutate per-device sync settings
- [Phase 26]: Global auto_sync off UX remains explicit-only (auto_sync === false) for banner visibility and disable cascade.
- [Phase 26]: Settings navigation category state is one-shot and cleared after consumption to prevent stale tab forcing.
- [Phase 27]: Used HashMap<String, serde_json::Value> for keyboard_shortcuts for flexible override storage
- [Phase 27]: Used mod prefix for all shortcut definitions for cross-platform compatibility (mod = Cmd on Mac, Ctrl on others)
- [Phase 28]: Used same binary codec pattern as clipboard_payload_v3.rs for FileTransferMessage consistency
- [Phase 28]: Extracted write_string_u16/read_string_u16 helpers for reuse across message variants
- [Phase 28]: Rejected filenames containing '..' anywhere (not just as path component) for extra safety
- [Phase 28]: First non-comment URI line determines file vs link classification per RFC 2483
- [Phase 28]: File category now filterable via ct.file toggle (was always-true)

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 23 added: Distributed tracing with trace view visualization for cross-device observability
- Phase 24 added: Implement per-device sync settings for paired devices
- Phase 25 added: Implement per-device sync content type toggles
- Phase 26 added: Implement global sync master toggle and improve sync UX
- Phase 27 added: 支持快捷键设置在 settings page 中
- Phase 28 split: Original monolithic file sync phase split into 4 phases (28-31)
- Phase 28 updated: File sync foundation — message types, ports, classification fix, schema, settings
- Phase 29 added: File transfer service — chunked protocol, use cases, retry logic
- Phase 30 added: File sync UI — Dashboard file entries, context menu, progress, notifications
- Phase 31 added: File sync settings and polish — settings UI, quota enforcement, auto-cleanup

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 22 likely needs extra validation around CLEF field mapping and Seq waterfall/query behavior.
- Existing `log::*` and `tracing::*` coexistence may need an audit during Phase 19 to avoid mixed-output surprises.
